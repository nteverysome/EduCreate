**Description**:
```markdown
## 🎯 Problem Solved

Fixed critical Vercel deployment issues causing 401 errors and build failures:

1. **401 Authentication Errors** - Missing NextAuth environment variables
2. **Prisma Build Failures** - Path detection issues in Vercel environment
3. **Deployment Configuration** - Simplified and optimized build process

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Environment Variables Solution
- ✅ Created comprehensive setup guide (`VERCEL_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES_FIX.md`)
- ✅ Added environment variables checker script (`scripts/check-env-vars.js`)
- ✅ Added NextAuth secret generator (`scripts/generate-nextauth-secret.js`)

### Prisma Integration Fixes
- ✅ Enhanced Prisma generation script with multi-path detection
- ✅ Added Vercel-specific build strategies
- ✅ Simplified build process to `prisma generate && next build`

### Build Process Optimization
- ✅ Updated `vercel.json` with reliable build command
- ✅ Cleaned up `package.json` postinstall script
- ✅ Added fallback mechanisms for different environments

## 🎊 Root Cause Analysis

The 401 errors were caused by missing environment variables in Vercel:
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Not set to Vercel deployment URL
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Missing authentication secret
- `DATABASE_URL` - Neon database connection not configured

## 🛠️ Required Actions

1. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel**:
   ```
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://edu-create-mzy0xc7lb-minamisums-projects.vercel.app
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[Generated 32-character secret]
   DATABASE_URL=[Neon production branch connection string]
   ```

2. **Redeploy Project** after setting variables

## 🧪 Testing

- ✅ Local builds working with both strategies
- ✅ Environment checker validates configuration
- ✅ Prisma generation handles multiple path scenarios
- ✅ NextAuth secret generator provides secure keys

## 📚 Documentation

- Complete troubleshooting guide included
- Step-by-step environment setup instructions
- Diagnostic tools for future debugging
- Comprehensive error resolution documentation

## 🎯 Expected Results

After merging and configuring environment variables:
- ✅ Vercel deployment succeeds without errors
- ✅ Website accessible without 401 errors
- ✅ User authentication works correctly
- ✅ Database integration functions properly
- ✅ All MVP games and features available
```
